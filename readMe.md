Creating the foundation by sketching a plan for how the page should look. I want to divide the content into sections, where I have nuts, chips, and crackers separately. Beverages will also be separated, such as carbonated and non-carbonated drinks. Each of these sections will have its own array. The idea is to implement a system that randomly selects a part from each array to create prefab 'packs' that users can choose from.

Each object in the arrays has three parts: name, price, and allergens, for the purpose of sorting based on these three aspects. For beverages, there may also be options for with or without sugar.

For the navigation bar, I'm drawing inspiration from a tutorial on YouTube.

struggling really hard with getting the "add to cart" function to work properly. Finally I got it right. Experimenting with sessions to see if I can get the page to allow the user to add multiple products to the cart. Now I have a big decision to make. either I scrap the fancy navbar since I cant make it work properly between pages of the website or I dig my head in and continue to waste time on trying to make it work. 
Fixed an rudementirary filter function
