### Dag 1
Creating the foundation by sketching a plan for how the page should look. I want to divide the content into sections, where I have nuts, chips, and crackers separately. Beverages will also be separated, such as carbonated and non-carbonated drinks. Each of these sections will have its own array. The idea is to implement a system that randomly selects a part from each array to create prefab 'packs' that users can choose from.

Each object in the arrays has three parts: name, price, and allergens, for the purpose of sorting based on these three aspects. For beverages, there may also be options for with or without sugar.

For the navigation bar, I'm drawing inspiration from a tutorial on YouTube.
I spent way to long on modifying every picture so it would show my logo instead of the brand logo and changing the names to made up ones. 

### dag2 
struggling really hard with getting the "add to cart" function to work properly. Finally I got it right. Experimenting with sessions to see if I can get the page to allow the user to add multiple products to the cart. Now I have a big decision to make. either I scrap the fancy navbar since I cant make it work properly between pages of the website or I dig my head in and continue to waste time on trying to make it work. 
Fixed an rudementirary filter function
Also worked on accesability. trying to make sure it works properly on all screens. But the way the navbar is constructed made it hard. So instead I removed the navbar for small screens and only kept the icons. 


### dag 3

I remembered to add a prefabricated bundle option. So I worked on this for way to long. It was probably the hardest thing to do so far in this project. Perhaps due to how my objectarray is built or mayby its becouse of something else but I just could nit get it to work. I spent the entire day on this one thing. When I finally got it to work somewhat correct I settled and called it a day.
